# User Personas

We want to help users who know what a tree is but not much more than that, they can come here to begin learning about trees. This site is not design for tree experts.

## Middle-school Student

<!--list-->

- Bio: Andrea is a middle school student taking her first biology class.
  
- Needs/goals: She just needs enough information to write a 2-page report introducing trees.
 
- Frustrations: Most sources that talk about trees already assume you know quite a bit about plants and biology , this makes it challenging for her to get started on the report.
- Scenario 1: Andrea needs to do a 2-page report on trees and doesn't know where to start. She really does want to learn about trees, she would love to spend a month writing an in-depth report on them. But she also has a geometry  test next week and a letter due for Dutch 101 so she's just trying to write the best report she can in a few days before moving on.

### Local Government Worker
<!--list--> 
- Bio: Phyllis works in the local government, her job is to approve funding for citizen-led projects.
- Needs/Goals: She needs to meet with citizen groups to review their proposals and funding requests.If their proposals are solid and their funding requests are reasonable she is authorized to provide funding upto -- per year. This requires learning a little bit about a lot topics so she can judge citizen proposals. 

- Frustrations: It is usually a hard to find resources that provide enough intro-level knowledge about a topic for her to judge a proposal, without overwhelming her. Most sources either have too much info or not exactly the information she needs to understand a proposal.

- Scenario 1: She needs to attend a meeting next week with a group of citizen volunteering to plant and maintain trees in public parks. She needs to know enough about how trees wotk so she can judge if this group will actually be able to maintain the trees, and to decide if the amount of funding they request is reasonable
